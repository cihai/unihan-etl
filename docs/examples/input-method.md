# Input Method Development

UNIHAN-ETL provides the data needed to create Chinese input methods, such as pinyin-to-character conversion systems.

## Building a Simple Pinyin Input Method

This example demonstrates how to build a basic pinyin-to-character mapping:

```{literalinclude} ../../tests/examples/test_input_method.py
:language: python
:linenos:
:caption: Input method development
```

## Components of an Input Method

A Chinese input method typically requires:

1. **Pronunciation Mapping**: Mapping pronunciations (like pinyin) to characters
2. **Frequency Data**: Sorting characters by usage frequency
3. **Contextual Prediction**: Predicting likely next characters based on context
4. **User Dictionary**: Storing user preferences and frequently used phrases

UNIHAN-ETL provides data for the first two components, allowing you to create sophisticated input methods.

## Extended Input Method Applications

### Intelligent Character Suggestion

Build systems that suggest characters based on frequency and context:

```{literalinclude} ../../tests/examples/test_intelligent_input.py
:language: python
:linenos:
:caption: Intelligent character suggestion
```

### Multi-language Input Methods

Extend your input method to support multiple languages:

```{literalinclude} ../../tests/examples/test_multilingual_lookup.py
:language: python
:linenos:
:caption: Multilingual character lookup
```

## Tips for Input Method Development

- Include frequency data to improve character suggestions
- Consider context for better prediction accuracy
- Optimize for performance, especially for large datasets
- Handle homonyms (same pronunciation, different characters) effectively
- Allow for user customization and learning
