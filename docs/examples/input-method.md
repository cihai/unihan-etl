# Input Method Development

UNIHAN-ETL provides the data needed to create Chinese input methods, such as pinyin-to-character conversion systems.

## Building a Simple Pinyin Input Method

This example demonstrates how to build a basic pinyin-to-character mapping:

```{literalinclude} ../../tests/examples/test_input_method.py
:language: python

```

## Components of an Input Method

A Chinese input method typically requires:

1. **Pronunciation Mapping**: Mapping pronunciations (like pinyin) to characters
2. **Frequency Data**: Sorting characters by usage frequency
3. **Contextual Prediction**: Predicting likely next characters based on context
4. **User Dictionary**: Storing user preferences and frequently used phrases

UNIHAN-ETL provides data for the first two components, allowing you to create sophisticated input methods.

## Extended Input Method Applications

### Intelligent Character Suggestion

Build systems that suggest characters based on frequency and context:

```python
# Conceptual example of intelligent character suggestion
def suggest_characters(pinyin, context=None):
    candidates = pinyin_to_chars.get(pinyin, [])
    
    # If we have context, prioritize characters that form common words
    if context and candidates:
        # Sort by likelihood given context
        return sorted(candidates, key=lambda c: score_in_context(c, context), reverse=True)
    
    # Otherwise sort by frequency
    return sorted(candidates, key=lambda c: character_frequency.get(c, 0), reverse=True)
```

### Multi-language Input Methods

Extend your input method to support multiple languages:

```python
# Conceptual example of multilingual support
lang_to_pronunciation = {
    "mandarin": kMandarin_data,
    "cantonese": kCantonese_data,
    "japanese": kJapaneseOn_data,
    "korean": kKorean_data
}

def lookup_character(pronunciation, language="mandarin"):
    pronunciation_data = lang_to_pronunciation.get(language, {})
    return pronunciation_data.get(pronunciation, [])
```

## Tips for Input Method Development

- Include frequency data to improve character suggestions
- Consider context for better prediction accuracy
- Optimize for performance, especially for large datasets
- Handle homonyms (same pronunciation, different characters) effectively
- Allow for user customization and learning
