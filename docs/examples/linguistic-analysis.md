# Linguistic & Research Analysis

UNIHAN-ETL provides valuable data for linguistic research and analysis of Chinese characters.

## Linguistic Analysis

This example demonstrates how to extract and analyze linguistic properties of characters:

```{literalinclude} ../../tests/examples/test_linguistic_analysis.py
:language: python
:linenos:
:caption: Linguistic analysis of characters
```

## Research Applications

UNIHAN-ETL can be used for academic research on Chinese characters:

```{literalinclude} ../../tests/examples/test_research_analysis.py
:language: python
:linenos:
:caption: Research analysis of characters
```

## Linguistic Research Applications

### Character Evolution Studies

Trace the historical development of characters across time:

```{literalinclude} ../../tests/examples/test_historical_variants.py
:language: python
:linenos:
:caption: Historical variant analysis
```

### Cross-language Comparisons

Compare character usage across Chinese, Japanese, and Korean:

```{literalinclude} ../../tests/examples/test_cross_language_comparison.py
:language: python
:linenos:
:caption: Cross-language comparison
```

## Tips for Linguistic Research

- Combine UNIHAN data with other linguistic resources for comprehensive analysis
- Consider the historical development of characters when analyzing variants
- Document your methodology clearly for academic reproducibility
- Validate findings against established linguistic research
- Use statistical methods to identify patterns in character usage and structure
